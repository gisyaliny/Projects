    "* A database is an organized collection of structured data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. \n",
    "* Despite the recent development of new types of databases (designed to address the increasing volume and variability of data), a considerable amount of data around the world is still stored in what are known as **relational databases**.\n",
    "    * **Relational databases** store data as **collections of predefined tables** with rows and columns that are connected through one or more relationships. \n",
    "    *  The standard way to create and manage databases is `SQL` (Structured Query Language). `SQL` is the building block for some of the most popular relational databases on the market, such as `PostgreSQL`, `Microsoft SQL Server`, `MySQL`, and `SQLite`\n",
